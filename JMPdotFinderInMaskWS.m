% 110309 -173 'added minimum ITMax size critereon'.adam 
% 110309 -194 'redefined cutOff to attempt to capture more accurate punta
%   volume'.adam
%
% 010510 HO Gmode is set to the peak of the noise distribution rather than
%   minimum voxel intensity.
% 010510 HO Instead of throwing away dots found in the OUTER HALF of the
%   buffer region, throw away dots found in the entire buffer region.
% 010510 HO Modified to apply mask before dot-finding so that only spaces 
%   around dendrites are searched for potential dots.
% 011810 HO Added the saving of Gmode in Settings.dotfinder to check if
%   the newly defined Gmode is not too high.
% 021210 HO Changed the way to calculate cutOff to estimate the contour of
%   dots. Now you can assign the range of cutOff (upper bound for smallest 
%   ITMax dots (actually ITMax=0 although not existing) and lower bound for 
%   largest possible ITMax).
% 051210 -260 'added watershed function to assign more appropriate regions
%   to multipeak iterative threshold dots'. AAB
% 060710 HO modified AAB's watershed, do watershed for the whole
%   thresholdMap instead of repeating it for all the multipeak puncta. This
%   will remove the whole processings for multipeak puncta in the previous
%   version because multipeak puncta are divided into single-peak puncta in
%   wsTMLabels before going into the contour loop.
% 060710 HO also previous modification for Gmode was stupid, now just take
%   the mode of non-zero voxels, and do iteration up to Gmode+1.
% 020811 HO changed line 230, instead of removing all the voxels that have
% iteration of < Settings.dotfinder.itMaxMin, set a different threshold for
% removing voxels. Since itMaxMin was confusing name for this purpose, I 
% set up Settings.dotfinder.itMin, and now voxels whose iteration was < 
% itMin, which I set to 2 for now, will be removed before taken to 
% watershed because those voxels that have only 1 iteration will be likely
% noise. Then, HO introduced Settings.dotfinder.minFinalDotITMax in line 
% 290 so that dots whose itMax is < minFinalDotITMax will be excluded from
% the registration intoDots. This way, if minFinalDotITMax is set to 4, you
% still keep voxels that had 2 iterations for dots whose itMax was 4, but 
% not for those whose itMax was 3.
% 020811 HO added NumPeak to adjust max dot size limitation for multi-peak
% object (around line 190). I added if-end loop before dot registration to
% limit the size of the individual dots because allowing larger size
% limitation for multi-peak object creates artificially large dots.
% 020911 HO Some voxels could be shared by multiple dots, which would not 
% happen if the stack was not divided into sub-matrix. This happens around
% the dividing lines of sub-matrices. Instead of removing less brighter
% overlapping dot later in Singles criterion in anaSG, re-assign those
% voxels to a single dot. This operation was added in the last part of the
% program.
% 021511 HO added around 305, which excludes dots whose final size is
% < Settings.dotfinder.minFinalDotSize from the registration into Dots.
